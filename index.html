				<p>Cree School is a game that helps you learn Cree! This game has quizzes for a bunch of subjects to help learn Cree ie. Nouns, Pronouns, Plurals, and Verb Conjugation. The game also has built-in modding support to add new quizzes. This can be for either new Cree quizzes, or make your own for an Indigenous language you know! This is not intended to teach you Cree, but rather a supplementary resource to practice Duolingo-style!</p>
