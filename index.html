				<p>Cree School is a game that helps you learn Cree!</p>
				<p>This game has quizzes for a bunch of subjects to help learn Cree ie. Nouns, Pronouns, Plurals, and Verb Conjugation.</p>
				<p>The game also has built-in modding support to add new quizzes. This can be for either new Cree quizzes, or make your own for an Indigenous language you know!</p>
				<p>This is not intended to teach you Cree, but rather a supplementary resource to practice Duolingo-style!</p>

				<p>To create a data pack, follow the following steps! A basic understanding of json is assumed, but looking at the example you can download should help!</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Go into Settings, Game Settings, and enable "Custom Content"</li>
					<li>Open the root folder and go into "data_packs" if it does not exist, create it.</li>
					<li>Create a folder, its name should be its "source name" the internal id for the data pack.</li>
					<li>Go into the folder and create "datapack.json" this will define important elements of the data pack.</li>
					<li>"datapack.json" needs "source_name" which should be the same as the folder name, "name" which is the name of the pack, "author" which is your name!</li>
					<li>"datapack.json" also needs "information" which needs "made_for" the version of the game it is made for, and can optionally define "version" and "website".</li>
					<li>Run the game and your data pack will be loaded.</li>
					<li>Add content to your data pack.</li>
					<li>Finally, when you are finished, zip the folder up for distribution!</li>
				</ol>

				<p>To create a quiz, follow the following steps!</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Create a folder in your data pack folder called "quizzes".</li>
					<li>Create a json file, it can be named whatever, the game internally uses "quiz_{quiz number}_data.json".</li>
					<li>The quiz file requires "type" which can be "random_multiple_choice", "four_choices", "this_or_that", or "verb_conjugation". Which type is used affects what data will be required.</li>
					<li>Next, it requires "id" which is the quiz id. It must be "quiz.{quiz number}".</li>
					<li>Next, it requires "name" which is a translation key.</li>
					<li>Next, it requires "questions" which is an array of questions.</li>
					<li>Creating a question requires "question" which is a translation key for the question, "answer" which is the answer id, and "has_syllabics" which is a boolean that will handle any questions that use Latin + non-Latin alphabets.</li>
					<li>If the type is "verb_conjugation", questions also require "suffix" and "prefix" which are integers pointing to the morpheme to conjugate a verb. "prefix" can be -1 to disable its requirement.</li>
					<li>A question can also have "icon" which points to a texture that will appear below the question.</li>
					<li>After questions is the answers. These depend on the type.</li>
					<li>If the type is "random_multiple_choice" or "verb_conjugation" it is an array of answers.</li>
					<li>If the type is "four_choices" it requires four objects, "answer_1", "answer_2", "answer_3", and "answer_4".</li>
					<li>If the type is "this_or_that" it requires two objects, "answer_1" and "answer_2".</li>
					<li>However an answer is made, it requires "id" which is the answer id a question will reference, "answer" a translation key for the answer, and "has_syllabics" which is a boolean that will handle any questions that use Latin + non-Latin alphabets.</li>
					<li>An answer can also have "sound" which points to a sound that will appear as a pronunciation box next to the answer.</li>
					<li>If the type is "verb_conjugation" it also requires an array of "morphemes".</li>
					<li>A morpheme takes in "is_suffix" which is a boolean that will either put it in the "suffix" or "prefix" category for verb conjugation.</li>
					<li>Next a morpheme takes in "name" which is a translation key.</li>
					<li>Final a morpheme takes in "rule" which applies various things to a base infinitive. If it is not required it can be "none". To add a letter to the infinitive, start with "+" then the letter, "/" means when, and "v" is the only valid one and will apply if the morpheme is followed by a vowel. It will add before the infinitive if it a prefix and after if it is a suffix. If a letter is replaced start with ">", the letter to be replaced with, "/" then when, only "l" is currently valid, which is last. Then, "/" and the later to be replaced.</li>
					<li>After answers and/or morphemes, "next_quiz" is optional to create a quick link to the next quiz, which takes in the "id" field of the quiz it links to.</li>

				<p>To create a translation file, follow the following steps!</p>
				<ol>
					<li>In your data pack folder create "translations.json" and a folder called "lang".</li>
					<li>"translations.json" should be an array. To create a translation for a valid language, add "file" which points to a file in the "lang" folder and "code" which defines the language it is for. Currently, only "en_us" is valid.</li>
					<li>In "lang" folder create "{language code}.json" and in it you can put all translation strings and their translations.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>To add a texture, follow the following steps!</p>
				<ol>
					<li>In your data pack folder create "textures.json" and a folder called "textures".</li>
					<li>"textures.json" should be an array. To create a texture, add "{texture_name}" which points to a file in the "textures" folder. It should be a ".png" though the "textures.json" decleration should not have neither the "textures/" path nor ".png" extension.</li>
					<li>In "textures" folder put your desired texture.</li>

				<p>To add a sound, follow the following steps!</p>
				<ol>
					<li>In your data pack folder create "sounds.json" and a folder called "sounds".</li>
					<li>"sounds.json" should be an array. To create a sound, add "{sound_name}" which points to a file in the "sounds" folder. It should be a ".ogg" though the "sounds.json" decleration should not have neither the "sounds/" path nor ".ogg" extension.</li>
					<li>In "sounds" folder put your desired sound.</li>
